                This set up uses two potentiometers and one photoresistor to create a controllable RGB LED. The potentiometers can be used to alter colour intensities
                while the photoresistor is used to make the LED blink or stay lit consistently. <br> <br>
                Calculations: The photoresistor and potentiometers both uses a 10K resistor to create a variable voltage. The Arduino output is 5V, 
                and we desire a 20mA current across the circuit for the RGB LED. V = IR, where V = 5, I = 20mA, and R = unknown resistor value. The RGB LED 
                has 3 separate anodes for each coloured LED. The red & green LEDs has a voltage drop of 1.8V and the blue LED has a voltage drop of 3.4V. <br>
                R = V / I <br>
                R = (5 - 1.8) / 0.02 = 160 (Green and Red LEDs) <br>
                R = (5-3.4) / 0.02 = 80 (Blue LED) <br>
                I have chosen to use a 220 ohm resistor for all 3 legs as it will keep the current in the circuit under the 
                recommended amount, allowing the RGB LED to operate with good stability.
                <br>
                <br>
                Additionally, the photoresistor and potentiometers act as voltage dividers in the circuit, allowing the output voltage to be a fraction
                of the input's. The potentiometer's output can be read through Arduino's analogRead, and mapping the value to 0 - 5. The normal readind
                hovers at around 500 when turned to maximum, which translates to about 2.44 Volts. At minimum, it reads 1023 which translate to the full
                5 Volts of the input.
                <br>
                <br>
                NOTE: I added a cardboard divider so the intensity of the LED won't mess with the photoresistor.
